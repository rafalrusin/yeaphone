.SH NAME
yeaphone \- A SIP phone for Yealink USB-P1K handsets using liblinphone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yeaphone
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The goal of the \fBYeaphone\fP project is to provide a user interface on a
Yealink USB handset <http://www.yealink.com/en/index.asp> for the VoIP
software Linphone thus making a PC keyboard and monitor unneccessary.
This makes Yeaphone ideal for "Embedded Devices" which work very energy
efficient but typically need an extra devices for user interaction (in
this case the handset).
.PP
Its features include
    * Display the phone number of incoming and outgoing calls
    * Show the duration of a call
    * Allows to store and recall 10 phone numbers
    * Mute the ring tone of incoming calls
    * Adjustable volume of the speaker
.PP
Yeaphone has to be configured through linphonec, the console version
of Linphone. The following example shows how to get a working connection
to a VoIP provider.
.PP
    root@NSLU2:~# \fBlinphonec\fP
    Ready
    linphonec> \fBsoundcard list\fP
    0: ALSA: default device
    1: ALSA: USB Audio
    2: ALSA: VOIP USB Phone
    3: OSS: /dev/dsp
    4: OSS: /dev/dsp1

    Adding new proxy setup. Hit ^D to abort.
    Enter proxy sip address: \fBsip:sipgate.at\fP
    Your identity for this proxy: \fBsip:1234567@sipgate.at\fP
    Do you want to register on this proxy (yes/no): \fByes\fP
    Specify register expiration time in seconds (default is 600): \fB600\fP
    Expiration: 600 seconds
    Specify route if needed: \fB[leave empty]\fP
    No route specified.
    --------------------------------------------
    sip address: sip:sipgate.at
    route:
    identity: sip:1234567@sipgate.at
    register: yes
    expires: 600
    --------------------------------------------
    Accept the above proxy configuration (yes/no) ?: \fByes\fP
    Proxy added.
    linphonec>
    Password for 1234567 on "sipgate.at": \fB[enter password]\fP
    Registration on sip:sipgate.at sucessful.
    linphonec>

Using linphonec the VoIP connection can be tested immediately before
using Yeaphone. The speaker and microphone of the Yealink handset can be
used already, commands still have to be entered through the PC keyboard
though. The most important commands of linphonec are:

    * help [<command>]
      shows the available commands and provides a detailed description
      for each command
    * call <phone number or SIP address>
      dials the specified phone number of SIP address
    * answer
      answers an incoming call
    * terminate
      terminates an (incoming or outgoing) call
    * quit
      unregisters at the VoIP provider and quits linphonec

As soon as calls can be make this way, linphonec can be stopped and
yeaphone can be invoked. Its output should look similar to this:

    root@NSLU2:~# \fByeaphone\fP
    path_sysfs = /sys/bus/usb/drivers/yealink/3-1.3:1.3/
    path_buf = /dev/input/event2
    Ready
    Registration on sip:sipgate.at sucessful.

At the same time the current date and time are show on the handset's
display, a quick sequence of status messages appear, and finally the
lower part of the display should be empty. Now the handset's keyboard
can be used to place and receive calls.

The various keys have the following functions:

   1. before a phone call
          * 0-9
            Dial a phone number
          * C
            Remove the last character of the dialed number
          * C pressed long
            Remove the complete number
          * <red key>
            Remove the complete number
          * <green key>
            Initiate the call
          * # + <0-9>
            No number dialed yet: Recall and display a number from
            memory X
            Number already dialed: Store the currently displayed number
            at memory X
   2. during a phone call
          * 0-9,*,#
            Generate DTMF tones
          * <red key>
            Terminate the call
          * VOL+/-
            Adjust the speaker's volume 
   3. after a phone call (with the last number displayed)
          * 0-9
            Dial a new phone number
          * C
            Remove the complete number
          * <red key>
            Remove the complete number
          * <green key>
            Redial the last number
          * # + <0-9>
            Store the last number to memory /X/ 
   4. when the phone rings
          * #
            Mute the ringing without picking up
          * <red key>
            Immediately terminate the call without picking up
          * <green key>
            Pick up 
   5. general
          * <red key> pressed long
            Start and stop the VoIP connection (corresponds to turning
            on/off a phone) 

To correctly understand the phone number of incoming calls, Yeaphone
needs some adjustments in the file \fB~/.yeaphonerc\fP. After terminating
yeaphone the parameters \fBintl-access-code\fP, \fBnatl-access-code\fP, and
\fBcountry-code\fP should be changed accordingly, the default values work for
Austria only.
