URGENT:
-------
1 Fix the memory leak on the NSLU2!! This might be in one of the
  libraries used, in which case we would be out of luck for now.

2 use gettimeofday

Future Features:
----------------
* use just one thread for display timing, schedule according to
  pending time-outs. Resolution <= 50ms (?)

* store the complete SIP URL for last calls and stored calls

* whenever registration fails, restart the blinking LED

* allow to associate shell commands for each state change,
  eg. to turn down volume when there is an incoming call or
  to send an email when a call was missed.
  
* find out whether it is possible for an outgoing call to
  distinguish between the ringing and the party actually picking up;
  use this to display the correct number of seconds of the call!
  
* Nice to have: Include a web server for configuring the
  various features and to present the calls history
