Future Features:
----------------
* use just one thread for display timing, schedule according to
  pending time-outs. Resolution <= 50ms (?),
  use gettimeofday

* store the complete SIP URL for last calls and stored calls

* keep a history of incoming/outgoing calls and allow
  scrolling through it with the UP/DOWN buttons; the IN/OUT marker
  should tell whether it was an incoming or outgoing call, the
  time/date of the call should be shown and the number (right-most)
  would be an index.
  Q: Where to display the duration of the call???
  the calls history should be stored in a configurable file
  (so it can also be placed on a RAM drive)
  
* whenever registration fails, restart the blinking LED

* allow to associate shell commands for each state change,
  eg. to turn down volume when there is an incoming call or
  to send an email when a call was missed.
  
* find out whether it is possible for an outgoing call to
  distinguish between the ringing and the party actually picking up;
  use this to display the correct number of seconds of the call!

* provide some menu-driven console interface for configuring the
  various features and to present the calls history

* support different Yealink models
